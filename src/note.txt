Config file:
A config file stores reusable settings like database credentials separately from your main code. 
It helps keep your code clean, organized, and easy to update.
ex : db.js

What is a controllers folder?
It's where you put functions that handle what happens when someone visits a route.
It keeps your route logic clean and organized — instead of writing everything in one big file.


middlewares :
middleware functions are used to handle things like authentication or logging. 
For example, I might create an authentication middleware to check if a user is 
logged in before allowing them to access certain routes. The middleware would either
redirect them to the login page or allow them to proceed to the requested page


model: 
"The model folder contains schema definitions for database collections. 
It handles how data is structured, validated, 
and interacted with in the database, keeping the code clean and organized.

each model file defines one type of data and how it should be stored in the database

Schema definition means setting rules for how your data should look in the database.

For example, in a User schema, you define:

name should be a string,

email must be unique,

password is required.

Routes:
We use a routes folder to separate route logic and keep the code scalable and easy to manage, 
especially in big apps.

The routes folder is where we define URLs 
(like /users, /products) and connect them to functions that handle the request.

// routes/userRoutes.js handles /users
// routes/productRoutes.js handles /products

Why use index.js inside /routes?
Think of the routes folder as a "folder of mini-routers".
Each file (like contacts.js) handles a specific part of your API (e.g., contacts, users, products, etc).

he index.js in the routes folder is used to combine all 
these mini routers into one router that your main index.js (in src/) can import easily.

Why Use Node.js for Backend
JavaScript Everywhere (Frontend + Backend)

You can use the same language (JavaScript) on both frontend and backend, 
which improves productivity and simplifies full-stack development.

Non-blocking, Event-driven Architecture

Great for building real-time apps, like chat apps, gaming backends, or live dashboards.

Handles thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.

Huge Ecosystem (npm)

Access to a massive number of pre-built packages and modules via npm.

Fast Development & Prototyping

Lightweight, fast to set up, and supported by frameworks like Express, NestJS, or Fastify.

Scalability

Suitable for microservices and easily scalable using tools like PM2, Docker, or Kubernetes.

Strong Community Support

Tons of tutorials, support, and open-source projects available.



The model will handle all the logic for querying the database, 
while the controller will just handle HTTP requests and responses.
